We aim to build a web application , which will be a data archive for previously obtained data on flood and interactive prediction models .
Prediction will be based on space temporal analysis of data available using machine learning. Data for rainfall for a place will be regularly updated. Web application will also consist of a warning system which will be based on rainfall levels and relative chances of floods.Different levels of warning will trigger some events and ready to share informatory templates will be generated.Also data for the possible safest spots in and around that place i.e. places with altitudes higher than those that will be possibly affected by flood would be mapped.
